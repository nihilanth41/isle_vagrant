# ISLE Documentation Style Guide and Requirements

The ISLE Team asks that all potential contributors please familiarize themselves with this guide and its requirements **PRIOR** to committing documentation changes.

This document and project has been created to provide the ISLE project team and larger Islandora community with:

 * Markdown resources, on-boarding material and tools

 * How Markdown can be used for Documentation of ISLE Projects and additional efforts

 * How [Mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) is used for the creation of static Documentation pages from Markdown files.

## Documentation Requirements

- All documentation will be kept within the `docs` directory within the Github.com hosted git repository.

- Markdown (.md) files are to be used for all documentation.

- Any other type of submitted file type e.g. `.txt,.pdf,.doc,.rtf` will not be accepted.

- [Mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) is to be used for the generation of static documentation pages to be hosted on Github pages or locally.

## Documentation Style

* How-to(s) should be written for technical and non-technical audiences alike with clear fully tested steps, explanations and outcomes.
* Assumptions of prior technical knowledge should be avoided. If additional explanations potentially exceed an appropriate file length or context, the ISLE team recommends creating a `References` section with topical URLs providing additional documentation for further reading by endusers.
* Avoid gender specific references e.g. `he, she, her, him`, personification or casual first person perspective e.g. `you`. Use gender-neutral terms like "`enduser, one, they, a person`" etc.
* Please follow the `File Layout` [section](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/) of the [Mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) documentation when creating new documentation sections.

## What is Markdown?

* Markdown is a text to HTML conversion tool.

* The ISLE team prefers to use the "[GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github/)" syntax.

* Markdown was created by John Gruber of [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) fame

## Markdown Requirements

* A text editor like [Atom](https://atom.io/), Textedit or Notepad.
* Saving files with the `.md` extension

## Markdown Syntax

* [Mastering Markdown offical Github guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

* [Markdown Syntax (official Github cheat sheet)](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)

* [Markdown cheat sheet](https://beegit.com/markdown-cheat-sheet)

## Markdown Style

* A great starter [Template](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2)

* Good example of “how to” use a README.md. (Not all sections germane. [Example](https://github.com/GSA/api-documentation-template)

* More elaborate though clean example from [Netflix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix)
