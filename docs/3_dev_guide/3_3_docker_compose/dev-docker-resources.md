## What is Docker?

 > *"Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package."*

## What are Docker Containers?
 > *"A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings. A container is a runtime instance of a docker image."*  

 > *"The concept is borrowed from Shipping Containers, which define a standard to ship goods globally. Docker defines a standard to ship software."*
 [- Docker.com](https://www.docker.com/what-container)

 A Docker container consists of:

 * a Docker image
 * An execution environment
 * A standard set of instructions

## What are Docker Images?

 > *"An image is an inert, immutable, file that's essentially a snapshot of a container. Images are created with the build command, and they'll produce a container when started with run. Images are stored in a Docker registry such as registry.hub.docker.com"*

## What is Docker Compose?

* For this project, Docker Compose is used as an [orchestration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestration_(computing)) tool to run and manage all containers.

> *"Orchestration is the automated arrangement, coordination, and management of computer systems, middleware, and services."*
[- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestration_(computing))

> *"Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a Compose file to configure your application's services. Then, using a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration."*

## What is Docker Hub

> *"Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service which allows you to link to code repositories, build your images and test them, stores manually pushed images, and links to Docker Cloud so you can deploy images to your hosts. Provides a centralized resource for container image discovery, distribution and change management, user and team collaboration, and workflow automation throughout the development pipeline."*
