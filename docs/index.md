# Islandora Enterprise (ISLE)

Welcome to the Documentation for the Islandora Enterprise (ISLE) project.

## What is Islandora Enterprise (ISLE)?
Islandora Enterprise (ISLE) is a new project in development that will address one of the most significant pain-points in Islandora: installation and maintenance.

## How does it work?
ISLE separates an institutionâ€™s customizations from core code, and moves that core code into containers that are easily updated, simplifying and largely automating the process of installation and updates/maintenance of Islandora. ISLE also bundles together the best shared modules into a common, production-ready and security-hardened platform.

## Why is it needed?
Islandora is a powerful digital repository comprised of more than 80 different open-source software libraries. This complex ecosystem makes Islandora difficult and expensive to install, maintain and customize. ISLE lowers the barrier to entry for new schools while allowing existing members to reallocate funds towards development or ingestion instead of maintenance.

## How can you help?
ISLE is seeking support from the Islandora community to see the project through. This support can take several forms, depending on your institution's resources and ability to contribute. To help ISLE succeed, you can:
* Contribute time to testing or development
* Contribute funding to enable more MVP Wishlist items or towards Phase II of ISLE
* Tell others about ISLE
* Add your institution to the [ISLE Supporters](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ycx5ATbeWpUWvpZ6bwXws490CMgi0dyB9SBfPYUDEjk/edit?usp=sharing) to express your interest in adopting the finished product (this helps show community interest)
