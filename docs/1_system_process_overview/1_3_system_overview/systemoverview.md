## Introduction
[Islandora](http://islandora.ca/) is an open-source software [framework](https://github.com/Islandora) designed to help institutions and organizations and their audiences collaboratively manage, and discover digital assets using a best-practices framework.

ISLE is an orchestrated group of Docker containers to be run on a server, laptop or cloud instance with a minimal suite of tools enabling an efficient deploy and release of an updated production-ready Islandora environment.

ISLE functions as both an initial installer and maintenance updater with the ability to build new production, staging and sandbox environments as distributable, lightweight and fast “containers” in a [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) environment.

This process would allows institutions to choose between hosting:  

* locally on a laptop for development work
* locally in their Institutional data center
* in a cloud environment such as ([Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)).

ISLE’s production-ready platform is to be updated monthly with:

* critical security patches
* full stack software updates
* a suite of commonly installed features and solution packs.

ISLE is designed to be an evolving but trusted environment to help create a managed process for migrating to the next major release of Islandora (termed CLAW).
